## :hammer_and_pick: Built With

In Good Company’s front-end consists primarily of React, Apollo Client, Material UI, and CSS. Modular React components allowed for easy design implementation throughout. Personal CSS contributed to most of the UI/UX of the site.

In Good Company’s back-end consists primarily of Node.js, Prisma (ORM, Database, Server), and GraphQl. The backend of our application was handled by Prisma, which provided us with a database, ORM, and server. GraphQl replaced the typical RESTful architecture, by providing a single endpoint to mutate and query data from our database. Heroku was used for deployment of our app.
